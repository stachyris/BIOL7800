## Introduction
Hi There! My name is _Vinay KL_ and I am a first year PhD student at the [Faircloth Lab](https://www.faircloth-lab.org) at the Department of Biological Sciences at Louisiana State University. 


### Hobbies

I have always enjoyed being outdoor and loved watching **BIRDS**. Interestingly, I also have liking towards collecting stamps, coins and currency notess. 


-------------------------------------

Let's try and look at some code chunks and see if we can print some

```{bash}
git --version
```

```{bash}
r --version
```

That's it for this document. See you at next one!

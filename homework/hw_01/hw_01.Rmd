# Introduction
Hi there! My name is _Vinay KL_ and I am a first year PhD student at the [Faircloth Lab](https://www.faircloth-lab.org) at the Department of Biological Sciences, Louisiana State University. 


## Hobbies

I have always enjoyed being outdoor and loved watching **BIRDS**. Interestingly, I also have liking towards collecting stamps, coins and currency notes. 


-------------------------------------

Let's try and look at some code chunks and output some bash commands

```{bash}
git --version
```

```{bash}
r --version
```

-----------------------------------------

That's it for this time. See you at next one!

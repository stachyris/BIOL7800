* All the files related to data are under ``data`` directory. 
* There are two raw files - ``vertnet_latest_birds.csv`` and ``vertnet_6mil_records-2ea2e413e6584682a68b08d3a56c8493.tsv``, 
make sure to have both of them in the ``data`` folder. 
* Cleaned data file is also written to this directory as ``cleaned_vertnet.csv``.
* ``code`` directory has both .R and .Rmd files - some are executed through 
final report Rmd file and some are not executed but were ran standalone. 
* Cleaning steps is gonna take super long, (need to learn to write better functions) please be patient. 
* On my M2 Mac with 24GB RAM ``final_report.Rmd`` took close to 4 hours to completely render with peak RAM usage of ~13GB. 
* On the GitHub repo ``figs`` directory has first four figures with slightly different themes (I liked them better [theme_clean]) but I could not use them in the final report as it was messing up the report structure. 
* Under ``final_project`` directory there is a file ``references_final.bib`` make sure you have downloaded that file as well. This is stores the citations used in the study as bibTex.

Museum and Natural history collections are important, essential and 
invaluable source of earth history's biodiversity information. The specimens in natural history collections serve as the basis for numerous fields of basic science and research. Natural history collections also contain deep, taxon-specific information derived from global populations of plants, animals, fungi, and microorganisms.
